## Our own space to record our precious memories, RE:Frame  

Do you want to save 4 snapshots with a friend online?<br/>
Do you want to save 4 snapshots to share and share memories with your friends?<br/>
Remember your friends for a long time with **RE:Frame**<br/>

Recently, many 4 snapshots studios have sprung up, and many people visit the same photo studios as 4 snapshots of myself to record memories of that day. <br/>
It is difficult to manage amid the growing number of photos, and the downloaded online four-cut photos are often left in the messenger chat room and forgotten about their existence. <br/>
It's good to keep your own memories in real life, but they shine only when you save and share them. Save your memories in RE:Frame, share them with friends, and keep your precious moments. <br>
